                    <p>You should carefully evaluate your investing goals, degree of experience and risk tolerance
                        before deciding whether to trade on the cryptocurrency markets. The most fundamental rule is to
                        never risk capital you cannot afford to lose. Any off-exchange, foreign exchange and
                        cryptocurrency transaction involves a sizable exposure to risk, including but not limited to
                        leverage, creditworthiness, a lack of regulatory protection and market volatility, all of which
                        may have a significant impact on a currency's or currency pair's price or liquidity.</p>
                    <p>Using an internet-based trading system carries some hazards, including but not limited to
                        hardware, software and internet connection failure. When dealing online, Energeios is
