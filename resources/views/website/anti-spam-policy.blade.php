               <!-- <h1 class="pb-5">ANTI-SPAM POLICY</h1> -->
               <p>Energeios considers transmission or dissemination of any unsolicited mass or
                  unsolicited commercial e-mails (referred to as "Spam") as a serious and criminal violation.
                  Sending or causing the delivery of spam to any Energeios clients is absolutely banned
                  for users of the company's services.
               </p>
               <p>Energeios forbids the sending of emails to or through our website or services that
                  contain the following, according to the international anti-
               </p>
               <b>spam regulations:</b>
               <ul>
                  <li>Expired or invalid domain names</li>
                  <li>Fake or invalid headers</li>
                  <li>A third party's equipment without the third party's consent, or broadcast from or through a
                     third party's internet domain name.
                  </li>
                  <li>Any methods to falsify, conceal, or obfuscate information in order to determine the source
                     or the transmission path
                  </li>
                  <li>Other strategies for deceptive addressing</li>
                  <li>Violation of our Terms of Use</li>
                  <li>Content that is incorrect or deceptive, whether in the subject line or elsewhere</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Collecting email addresses or any other data regarding Energeios's clients or
                  subscribers through the website or its services is strictly prohibited. Additionally, it is
                  prohibited to use our services in a way that would obstruct another user's use of Energeios's services in anyway, or that would harm, disable, overburden, or impair any component of
                  the services.
               </p>
               <p>For the unlawful use of any Energeios service concerning the delivery of unsolicited
                  e-mail, including the transmission of e-mail that violates this policy, the sender and those
                  helping the sender may face civil, criminal, or administrative penalties. Outrageous offenders
                  may potentially face criminal prosecution, which might result in fines, equipment seizure, and
                  other punishments.
               </p>
               <h3>SPAM FILTERING SYSTEM </h3>
               <p>With regard to our established guidance of terms and conditions, Energeios's
                  sophisticated and improved messaging systems automatically check any incoming messages as well
                  as other emails and filter-out emails that are considered spam.
               </p>
               <h3>ISSUES WITH FILTERING</h3>
               <p>Since no spam screening mechanism is 100% reliable, occasionally legitimate emails maybe rejected
                  by Energeios's platforms. If you consider this to be the case with the email you sent,
                  kindly notify the recipient via another channel and let him know the accuracy of it.
               </p>
               <p>By sending emails in plain text (i.e., without HTML), removing any attachments, ensuring that
                  your emails are scanned for Trojans before sending them, and avoiding the use of language that
                  is contrary to our spam policy, you can actually reduce the likelihood that your email will be
                  caught by spam filters.
               </p>
               <h3>SPAM MONITORING </h3>
               <p>If, in the unlikely event, you ever receive a message from Energeios or one sent
                  through Energeios's systems that you feel might be spam, please contact Energeios using the live chat feature on our official website. We will look into the situation as
                  soon as possible and apologize for any inconvenience.
               </p>

                  user regarding the aforementioned change or update of the anti-spam policy.
